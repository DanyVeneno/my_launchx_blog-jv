## üçÄ TO BE IN CONTEXT


Some years ago when i was young studing english lenguage at FES Acatl√°n, i learned a method to tell a story and i love it it seemed so easy to understand, the practice consisted on this way the teacher gave us some words and verbs that you can see below.

| . | . | . | .|
|:----:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| to live abroad | Turn off | Lie Down | to fill out |
| look out | looked forward | to go out | threw away |
| stand up| to live abroad |take off|got along|
|Grow Up|Walk out|looked forward|

So  in this way we have to build a story or whatever you want to tell using them, well this practice help me to express and write a story the result of this example you can read and listen on this link[ Subjetive](https://medium.com/@danielEDJV/subjetive-be6b41105ac5)

Someday wondering on the web find this amazing  group of persons that gave me a really help to start again i am talking about [@inovaccionvirtual](https://www.instagram.com/innovaccionvirtual/?hl=es)  this organization is helping me to improve my skills in frontend and backend so i have some words about this i will say something about this concepts some years ago (5) i take a course called web master well i got there because i needed to learn how to create a different gallery that i had on my website builded on DreamWeaver that was my first website and i was so proud of me but i didn't like the gallery  that's why im here learning  how to be a better web developer from the hand of LaunchX proyect.

# üê¢ RECAP

I'm so glad to be here but this is not at all during the second week at NodeJS Mission i was in trouble because
there is a specific rule when you are working with NodeJS
and the rule is not to forget create an **.gitignore** and write the documents that not need to be uploaded, well accidents happens so i knew about this rule and i did it i upload to the GitHub repository so a classmate @MarcosSilvaG find how to fix this common beginner error that i did if you fall in the same mistake you can fix it in this link [Fix node_modules uploaded](https://github.com/LaunchX-InnovaccionVirtual/MissionNodeJS/discussions/98)

```js
class Human{
  constructor(name, lastName, age, nationality, stacks, greeting){
    this.name = name
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.age = age
    this.nationality = nationality
    this.stacks = stacks
    this.greeting = greeting
  }

  getInfo(){
    return `Este humano se llama ${this.name}
    ${this.lastName} y tiene ${this.age} de edad, su nacionalidad es ${this.nationality} y esta aprendiendo a programar en ${this.stacks}y te manda saludos ${this.greeting}`
  }
}
const me = new Human("Daniel", "Vallejo", "43 a√±os", "Mexicana","Node Js y Javascript", "desde M√©xico")
console.log(me.getInfo())

```

""_until the next post, have a nice day_**
